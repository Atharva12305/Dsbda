    ```
  - Note: The `LSTAT` column in row 4 contains `NaN`, indicating a missing value.

**Purpose**: Provides a quick overview of the dataset’s structure, column names, and sample data.

---

#### **Cell 4: Checking for Missing Values**
```python
# Check for missing values
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

**Explanation:**
- **Methods Used**:
  - `df.isnull()`: Returns a DataFrame of the same shape as `df`, with `True` for missing values (`NaN`) and `False` otherwise.
  - `df.isnull().sum()`: Sums the `True` values (missing values) for each column, returning a Series with the count of missing values per column.
  - `print()`: Outputs the results to the console.

- **Output**:
  ```
  Missing values in each column:
  CRIM       20
  ZN         20
  INDUS      20
  CHAS       20
  NOX         0
  RM          0
  AGE        20
  DIS         0
  RAD         0
  TAX         0
  PTRATIO     0
  B           0
  LSTAT      20
  MEDV        0
  dtype: int64
  ```
  - Columns `CRIM`, `ZN`, `INDUS`, `CHAS`, `AGE`, and `LSTAT` each have 20 missing values.
  - Other columns (`NOX`, `RM`, `DIS`, `RAD`, `TAX`, `PTRATIO`, `B`, `MEDV`) have no missing values.

**Purpose**: Identifies columns with missing data to inform preprocessing steps.

---

#### **Cell 5: Handling Missing Values**
```python
# Handling missing values (if any)
df = df.dropna()
```

**Explanation:**
- **Method Used**:
  - `df.dropna()`: Removes rows with any missing values (`NaN`) from the DataFrame.
    - **Default Parameters**:
      - `axis=0`: Drops rows (not columns).
      - `how='any'`: Drops a row if it contains at least one `NaN`.
    - **Output**: A new DataFrame with rows containing missing values removed.
  - `df = df.dropna()`: Reassigns the filtered DataFrame to `df`.

- **Data**:
  - Original `df`: 506 rows.
  - After `dropna()`: Rows with `NaN` in `CRIM`, `ZN`, `INDUS`, `CHAS`, `AGE`, or `LSTAT` are removed. Since 20 rows have missing values (and they may overlap), the resulting DataFrame has approximately 486 rows (exact number depends on overlap).

**Purpose**: Ensures the dataset is clean by removing rows with missing values, as linear regression cannot handle `NaN` values.

#### **Cell 6: Splitting the Dataset**
*(Note: The provided code is truncated and does not explicitly show this step, but based on typical linear regression workflows and the presence of `y_pred` and `residuals` in Cell 7, this step is implied. I'll assume a standard implementation.)*

**Assumed Code**:
```python
# Split features and target
X = df.drop(columns=['MEDV'])
y = df['MEDV']

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Data Preparation**:
  - `X = df.drop(columns=['MEDV'])`: Creates a DataFrame `X` containing all features by removing the target column `MEDV`.
    - **Output**: `X` has 13 columns (all features) and ~486 rows.
  - `y = df['MEDV']`: Creates a Series `y` containing the target variable (`MEDV`).
    - **Output**: `y` has ~486 values.

- **Function Used**:
  - `train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `X`: Feature data.
      - `y`: Target data.
      - `test_size=0.2`: Allocates 20% (~97 rows) for testing and 80% (~389 rows) for training.
      - `random_state=42`: Ensures reproducibility of the split.
    - **Returns**:
      - `X_train`: Training features (~389 rows, 13 columns).
      - `X_test`: Testing features (~97 rows, 13 columns).
      - `y_train`: Training target values (~389 values).
      - `y_test`: Testing target values (~97 values).

**Purpose**: Prepares the data for model training by separating features and target and splitting into training and testing sets.

#### **Cell 7: Training the Linear Regression Model**
*(Assumed based on context, as the code is truncated.)*

**Assumed Code**:
```python
# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Class Used**:
  - `LinearRegression()`: Instantiates a linear regression model, which fits a linear equation \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n \) to predict the target variable.

- **Method Used**:
  - `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`: Trains the model on the training data.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `X_train`: Training features.
      - `y_train`: Training target values.
    - **Process**: The model computes the coefficients (\(\beta_i\)) and intercept (\(\beta_0\)) that minimize the sum of squared residuals (differences between actual and predicted values).

**Purpose**: Trains the linear regression model to predict house prices based on the 13 features.

---

#### **Cell 8: Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model**
*(Assumed based on context, as `y_pred` and `residuals` are used in Cell 9.)*

**Assumed Code**:
```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate residuals
residuals = y_test - y_pred

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
print("R^2 Score:", r2)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Method Used**:
  - `model.predict(X_test)`: Generates predictions for the test set features (`X_test`).
    - **Output**: `y_pred`, an array of predicted `MEDV` values (~97 values).
  - `residuals = y_test - y_pred`: Computes the residuals (errors) as the difference between actual (`y_test`) and predicted (`y_pred`) values.
    - **Output**: `residuals`, an array of differences (~97 values).

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - `mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)`: Computes the average of squared residuals, indicating the model’s prediction error.
    - Formula: \( \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \)
    - **Output**: A single float value (e.g., ~20.0, depending on the data).
  - `r2_score(y_test, y_pred)`: Computes the coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance in `y_test` explained by the model.
    - Formula: \( R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \)
    - **Output**: A value between 0 and 1 (e.g., ~0.75, meaning 75% of variance explained).

**Purpose**: Evaluates the model’s performance on the test set using MSE and R².

#### **Cell 9: Visualizing Residuals**
```python
# Scatter plot of residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x=y_pred, y=residuals)
plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("Predicted Values")
plt.ylabel("Residuals")
plt.title("Residuals vs Predicted Values")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- **Functions and Methods Used**:
  - `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))`: Creates a new figure with a size of 8x6 inches.
  - `sns.scatterplot(x=y_pred, y=residuals)`: Creates a scatter plot using Seaborn.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `x=y_pred`: Predicted values (`y_pred`) on the x-axis.
      - `y=residuals`: Residuals (`y_test - y_pred`) on the y-axis.
    - **Purpose**: Visualizes the relationship between predicted values and residuals to check for patterns (ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around 0).
  - `plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')`: Draws a horizontal line at y=0 (the ideal residual value) in red with a dashed style.
  - `plt.xlabel("Predicted Values")`: Labels the x-axis.
  - `plt.ylabel("Residuals")`: Labels the y-axis.
  - `plt.title("Residuals vs Predicted Values")`: Sets the plot title.
  - `plt.show()`: Displays the plot in the Jupyter Notebook.

- **Output**:
  - A scatter plot where:
    - X-axis: Predicted house prices (`y_pred`).
    - Y-axis: Residuals (actual - predicted values).
    - A red dashed line at y=0 indicates where residuals would be if predictions were perfect.
    - Ideally, points should be randomly scattered around y=0 with no clear pattern, indicating a good model fit.

**Purpose**: Visualizes residuals to assess the model’s assumptions (e.g., homoscedasticity, linearity). Patterns in the plot (e.g., a funnel shape) suggest issues like heteroscedasticity.

#### **Cell 10: Empty Cell**
```python
# No code
```

**Explanation**: This cell is empty, likely a placeholder for additional code or notes.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- **Dataset**:
  - The Boston Housing dataset is a regression problem with 506 samples, 13 features, and a continuous target (`MEDV`).
  - Missing values in 6 columns (`CRIM`, `ZN`, `INDUS`, `CHAS`, `AGE`, `LSTAT`) are handled by dropping affected rows.

- **Linear Regression**:
  - Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target.
  - Fits a model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
  - Suitable for this dataset due to relatively linear relationships between features like `RM`, `LSTAT`, and `MEDV`.

- **Evaluation**:
  - **MSE**: Lower values indicate better fit (e.g., ~20.0 is reasonable for this dataset).
  - **R²**: Higher values (closer to 1) indicate better explanatory power (e.g., ~0.75 is good but suggests room for improvement).
  - The residual plot helps diagnose model fit; random scatter around y=0 is ideal.

- **Visualization**:
  - The residual plot is critical for checking linear regression assumptions:
    - **Linearity**: Residuals should not show a systematic pattern.
    - **Homoscedasticity**: Residual variance should be constant across predicted values.
    - **Normality**: Residuals should be approximately normally distributed (not directly checked here).

---

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Handle Missing Values Differently**: Instead of dropping rows, impute missing values (e.g., using mean/median or a model-based approach) to retain more data.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize features (e.g., using `StandardScaler`) to ensure features with different scales (e.g., `TAX` vs. `NOX`) contribute equally.
3. **Feature Selection**: Use techniques like correlation analysis or recursive feature elimination to select the most predictive features.
4. **Cross-Validation**: Use `cross_val_score` to evaluate the model more robustly across multiple splits.
5. **Residual Analysis**: Add a histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals to check normality.
6. **Advanced Models**: Try nonlinear models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) if linear regression underperforms.

---

### **Summary**
The code demonstrates a complete regression workflow:
- **Data Loading**: Loads the Boston Housing dataset from a CSV file.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values by dropping rows and splits data into training/testing sets.
- **Modeling**: Trains a linear regression model to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses performance using MSE and R².
- **Visualization**: Plots residuals to diagnose model fit.

Each function and method is used purposefully to build, evaluate, and interpret a regression model, making this a good example for learning linear regression concepts.
